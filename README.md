# Crafting an SPA with Umbraco

This repo contains the code from my [blog post](https://kjac.dev/posts/crafting-an-spa-with-umbraco/) about using Umbraco to power a single-page application (SPA).

Please check the blog post for a details.

## Running this sample

To run the sample, fire up a terminal in `src/Site` and run `dotnet run`.

If you want to play around with the content, you can access the Umbraco backoffice with:

- Username: admin@localhost
- Password: SuperSecret123
